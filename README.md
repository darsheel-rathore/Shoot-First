# Shoot First

Welcome to the repository for **Shoot First**, an online multiplayer top-down shooter game currently in its prototype stage. Please note that this project is intended for personal hobby and portfolio purposes rather than commercial release. The game incorporates 3D models provided by Synty Studios, available on the Unity Asset Store.

## Overview

**Shoot First** is an exciting online multiplayer game set in a desert-themed map with captivating low-poly graphics. The game employs Photon Unity Networking (PUN) to manage its networking components, facilitating seamless online interactions.

As of now, the game focuses on 5-player multiplayer free-for-all style gameplay. Players engage in combat, accumulating kills and dealing damage. However, it's important to mention that the game is currently in a very early pre-alpha stage, and certain features such as round or match outcomes are not supported.

## Features

- Top-down movement relative to the camera perspective.
- Well-defined strafing animations for fluid player movements.
- Customizable player nicknames.
- Creation and joining of game rooms.
- Synchronized firing and health systems for smooth gameplay.
- Synchronized animations for enhanced visual experience.
- Persistent tracking of health, kill scores, and damage dealt for players during and after matches.

## Tools

- **Engine:** Unity
- **Asset Modifications:** Blender
- **Codebase:** C#
- **Networking API:** Photon Unity Networking 2 (PUN 2)

## Game Modes

- **Free-For-All:** Accommodates up to 5 players in a single room for intense multiplayer battles.

## Controls

- **Movement:** W, S, A, and D keys control the player's movement direction.
- **Firing and Strafing:** Click and drag on the right side of the screen (or mouse movement) to control firing and strafing. Please note that this control system is designed with mobile devices in mind, resembling a joystick interface.
- **Mouse Control:** Since the initial target was mobile platforms, the controls mimic a joystick-like mechanism. However, for PC gameplay, W, S, A, and D keys control movement, while the mouse governs aiming and firing.

Please be aware that the control scheme is evolving as the game progresses through development stages.

## Installation and Usage

As the project is in its pre-alpha stage, there is currently no installation package available. However, you are welcome to clone the repository and explore the code and assets. Please note that the game is optimized for PC gameplay at this point.
